# NLP
Different traditional NLP approaches are 
- Linguistic Rules: These are manually created rules based on the structure and grammar of a language to process and understand text ( rule: a verb follows a noun).
- Handcrafted Features: Features manually designed by experts to capture important aspects of the text, such as word frequency or part-of-speech tags.
- Statistical Models: Models that use statistical methods to analyze and interpret text data. An example is the bag of words model, which represents a document as an unordered set of words, ignoring the order and structure of the words. It loses information about the order and context of words.
